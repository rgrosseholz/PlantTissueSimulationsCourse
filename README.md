# PlantTissueSimulationsCourse
This repository contains the models for the interactive lecturse, practical session and assignment of the multi-scale modelling in biology course.

The models are all build in VirtualLeaf, an open-scoure modelling tool for plant tissues (Merks et al. 2011, van Nieuwenhoven et al. (preprint), which is also available on GitHub (https://github.com/rmerks/VirtualLeaf2021).
